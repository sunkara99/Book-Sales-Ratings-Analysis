# Book Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis with Python)

## Executive Summary

This project analyzes a dataset of books (titles, publishing years, and related attributes) to uncover trends in publishing history. The analysis involved **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**, providing insights into publishing frequency, data quality, and overall dataset characteristics.

---

## Dataset

* **Source:** `Books_Data_Clean.csv` (custom dataset)
* **Key Fields:** Book Name, Publishing Year, Author, etc.
* Filtered to include only books published after **1900** for relevance.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Removed nulls in *Book Name*.
   * Dropped duplicate records.
   * Filtered invalid publishing years (before 1900).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Descriptive statistics with Pandas.
   * Frequency distributions using histograms.
   * Unique counts of books, authors, etc.

3. **Visualization Tools**

   * **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for plots.

---

## Key Insights

* Publishing activity after **1900** is the main focus.
* Identified missing values and duplicates, improving dataset quality.
* Publishing Year distribution highlights growth patterns in book production over time.

---

## Skills Highlighted

* **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Data Cleaning:** handling nulls, duplicates, and filters
* **Exploratory Analysis:** descriptive stats, distribution plots
* **Visualization & Communication** of results

---

## Next Steps

* Expand analysis to include **authors, genres, and ratings**.
* Build trend analysis â†’ how publishing frequency changes across decades.
* Add **interactive dashboards** (Power BI / Plotly) for dynamic exploration.
* Compare results across regions or publishers if data is available.
